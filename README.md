# Building-a-Active-DIrectory


Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft that manages and organizes users, computers, and other resources within a Windows network. It allows administrators to control access, apply policies, and authenticate users across the domain. Think of it as the central "brain" of an enterprise network, keeping everything connected and secure. üß†üîê

## Objective

Design and deploy a functional red team Active Directory lab environment using virtualization. Set up a Windows Server domain controller and a Windows 10/11 domain-joined machine to simulate a real-world enterprise network for practicing enumeration, exploitation, and lateral movement techniques.

## Skills Learned

- Setting up and configuring a Windows Active Directory (AD) lab environment for red team operations.
- Deploying and joining Windows 10/11 machines to a domain for realistic attack simulation.
- Installing and using red team tools like PowerView, SharpHound, and BloodHound for AD enumeration.
- Performing domain reconnaissance to discover users, groups, computers, and trust relationships.
- Simulating internal attacker behavior such as privilege enumeration and attack path mapping.
- Building hands-on experience with Windows internals and common Active Directory attack techniques.

## Steps

These are the steps to create an Active Directory.
